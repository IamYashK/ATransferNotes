DLP Step #1: Scope the program
Goal: Provide insight into data and business practices to allow DLP to address real issues without prompting disruption.

DLP Step #2: Start awareness and governance activities
Goal: Build a plan to communicate to all parties what is happening with data, why it is happening, the benefits, and the likely impacts on them.

DLP Step #3: Design initial architecture
Goal: Map your DLP use cases (detection and context requirements) to each enforcement point

DLP Step #4: Begin to address dependencies
Goal: Push for improvements on some of the dependencies identified early on.

DLP Step #5: Deploy, operate and evolve
Goal: Start small and deploy in stages, as DLP rollouts can be disruptive.
